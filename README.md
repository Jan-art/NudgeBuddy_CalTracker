# NudgeBuddy_CalTracker

This project is being developed as part of my final year project for my university degree program. 

# NUDGE BUDDY

This is a "nutrition tracker" app built using the Flutter framework. The app helps users to keep track of their daily food intake, set dietary goals, and monitor their progress.

Initially planned as a web platform, but due to specific functionality requirements it was decided to transition to mobile app development. 



# General Setup

1 - Clone this repository.

2 - Open the project in Android Studio or VSCode.

3 - Run the app on your emulator or device.
